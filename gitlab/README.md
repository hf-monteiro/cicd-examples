# GitLab CI Configuration Examples

This repository contains a collection of `gitlab-ci.yml` examples for various use cases and project environments. These examples are designed to help you get started with GitLab CI/CD pipelines, showcasing different strategies for building, testing, and deploying your applications.

## Getting Started

To use these examples, you'll need a GitLab account and a project where you can set up CI/CD pipelines. If you're new to GitLab CI/CD, it's recommended to read through [GitLab's CI/CD documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) to get familiar with the basics.

## Examples Overview

Below is a brief overview of each example included in this repository. For more detailed information, please refer to the specific configuration files and their comments.

## How to Use

To use an example in your project:

1. Copy the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file from the example directory to the root of your GitLab project.
2. Customize the file as needed for your project's specific requirements.
3. Commit and push the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file to your GitLab repository.
4. GitLab will automatically detect the file and start running your CI/CD pipeline based on the configurations provided.
